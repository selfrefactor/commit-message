# Tslint-fn

Tslint might be deprecated, but I so get used to the naming, so I am using it in this package, which just takes the burden to have 3 dependencies instead of just one.

## Update/Import rules

demo/.eslintrc.js

## Relation to `lint-fn`

They should have same `eslint` ?

## Issue

It works best with native Typescript projects.

For example in `Rambda` it doesn't work
